  &quot;Forty-two!&quot; yelled Loonquawl. &quot;Is that all you've got to show for seven and a half million years' work? &quot;</p>
<p>
&quot;I checked it very thoroughly,&quot; said the computer, &quot;and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is.&quot;

Iâ€™m a physicist, a string theorist by training, and I work in various aspects of data science, and string theory.

I started work in machine learning as a means to address open problems in theoretical physics, and am now interested in broader applications in the industry as well.

I usually work in Keras, and TensorFlow with dalliances in FastAI.

As for my work in string theory, I work on the AdS/CFT correspondence. Since its proposal in the 1990s this correspondence has provided profound insights into black holes, the nature of spacetime, how fluids flow, and the like.

I work on explaining how this correspondence comes into being.
